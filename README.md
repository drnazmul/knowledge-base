- Seems to have forgotten project context

**Solutions:**

**A. Verify Files Uploaded:**
```
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Check "Project knowledge"
3. Confirm all files present
4. Re-upload if missing
```

**B. Be Specific in Requests:**
```
❌ "Help me with grant proposal"
✅ "Use the FRGS template from grant-opportunities.md to start my NADES research proposal"
```

**C. Reference Files Explicitly:**
```
You: Check university-profiles.md. What's Monash Malaysia salary range?
Claude: [Now definitely uses that specific file]
```

**D. Check Custom Instructions:**
```
1. Project Settings → Custom instructions
2. Verify instructions are set
3. Re-paste from setup file if needed
```

---

### **Issue 2: Claude Responses Too Generic**

**Symptoms:**

**Solutions:**

**A. Remind Claude of Your Context:**
```
You: Remember I'm Dr. Alam with PhD in SPME, 17 papers, applying to Monash Malaysia for Green Chemistry position. Now help me with [specific task].
```

**B. Use Core Files:**
```
Make sure 00-core files are in every project:
- professional-profile.md
- cv-publications-list.md
- research-expertise-summary.md
```

**C. Provide More Context:**
```
❌ "Write cover letter"
✅ "Write cover letter for Monash Malaysia Green Chemistry Senior Lecturer position, emphasizing my complete course design and industry experience"
```

---

### **Issue 3: File Upload Limit Reached**

**Symptoms:**

```

---

### **Issue 4: Inconsistent Output Quality**

**Symptoms:**
- Sometimes great, sometimes mediocre
- Varies by session

**Solutions:**

**A. Start Conversations Well:**
```

This gives Claude full context immediately.
```

**B. Iterate and Refine:**
```
Don't accept first output:
You: This is good but needs more [specifics]. Revise to emphasize [aspect].
Claude: [Improved version]
```

**C. Use Templates:**
```
Reference specific templates:
"Use Template 1 from cover-letter-templates.md as base"
```

---

### **Issue 5: Information Out of Date**

- Outdated grant deadlines
- Old publication list

**Solutions:**

**A. Regular Updates:**
```
Monthly:
- Update CV with new publications

```

**B. Version Control:**
```
Use GitHub to track changes
Commit message: "Updated CV with new paper (Dec 2025)"
```

Review files quarterly
Update as needed
```

---

### **Issue 6: Can't Find Specific Information**

**Symptoms:**
- "Where did I put that template?"
- "Which file has the grant deadlines?"

**Solutions:**

**A. Use This Master Guide:**
```
This document (MASTER-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md) catalogs everything
Ctrl+F to search
```

**B. Consistent File Naming:**
```
Files are organized by:
- 00-core: Foundational
- 01-project-research: Research-related
- 02-project-content: Content-related
- 03-project-teaching: Teaching-related
- 04-project-job-search: Job search-related
