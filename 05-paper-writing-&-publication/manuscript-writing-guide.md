```
[Background] Traditional extraction methods for pharmaceutical residues 
in water rely on toxic organic solvents and generate significant waste. 
Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) offer green alternatives but have 
limited application in solid phase microextraction (SPME). 

[Objective] This work developed a choline chloride-glucose NADES-coated 
SPME fiber for extraction of six pharmaceutical residues from water samples.

[Methods] NADES composition was optimized using experimental design, and 
the fiber was characterized by SEM and FTIR. Extraction conditions were 
optimized, and the method was validated according to ICH Q2 guidelines.

[Results] The method achieved detection limits of 0.05-0.15 ng/mL for 
target pharmaceuticals with extraction recoveries of 85-105% and relative 
standard deviations below 7%. Compared to commercial PDMS fibers, the 
NADES coating provided 2-3 fold higher extraction efficiency while 
eliminating organic solvent use. The fiber showed excellent stability 
over 100 extraction cycles with minimal performance degradation.

[Conclusions] This green SPME method offers a sustainable alternative for 
pharmaceutical monitoring in environmental waters, demonstrating that 
NADES can serve as effective and environmentally friendly SPME coatings.

### **3. INTRODUCTION**

**Purpose:** Convince reviewers and readers that your work is important and novel

**Structure (2-3 pages):**

**Paragraph 1: The Big Picture**
- Why does this field matter?
- What's the broad problem?
- Who cares and why?

*Example:*
"Pharmaceutical contamination of water bodies poses emerging environmental 
and health risks, with residues from antibiotics, hormones, and analgesics 
detected in surface waters worldwide at ng/L to μg/L levels..."

**Paragraph 2-3: Current Approaches and Limitations**
- What are existing methods?
- What are their problems?
- Use recent references (last 5 years)

*Example:*
"Current extraction methods for pharmaceuticals in water include solid 
phase extraction (SPE) [ref], liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) [ref], and 
solid phase microextraction (SPME) [ref]. While SPME offers advantages 
of solvent-free extraction and in situ sampling [ref], traditional fiber 
coatings such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyacrylate (PA) show 
limited selectivity for polar pharmaceuticals [ref]. Moreover, commercial 
SPME fibers rely on synthetic polymers with environmental persistence..."

**Paragraph 4: The Gap**
- What's missing?
- What would solve the problem?

*Example:*
"Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) have emerged as green alternatives 
to organic solvents, formed by hydrogen bond interactions between natural 
components such as sugars, acids, and quaternary ammonium salts [refs]. 
Despite promising solvent properties, NADES application in SPME coatings 
remains largely unexplored, with only [X] previous reports [refs]..."

**Paragraph 5: Your Solution**
- What did you do?
- How is it novel?
- Why is it better?

*Example:*
"This work addresses this gap by developing NADES-coated SPME fibers 
specifically for pharmaceutical analysis in water. Using choline chloride-
glucose NADES immobilized on stainless steel wire through [method], we 
demonstrate [key advantages]. This represents the first application of 
NADES-SPME to pharmaceutical residue monitoring and expands green chemistry 
principles to microextraction techniques..."

**Final Paragraph: Study Objectives**
- Clear statement of what you did
- Bullet points acceptable

*Example:*
"The specific objectives were to: (1) synthesize and characterize choline 
chloride-glucose NADES with optimal viscosity and extraction properties, 
(2) develop NADES-coated SPME fibers and optimize extraction parameters, 
(3) validate the method for six pharmaceutical residues according to ICH 
guidelines, and (4) compare performance to commercial SPME fibers and 
traditional extraction methods."

in environmental waters. The method achieved detection limits of 0.05-0.15 
ng/mL with excellent precision (RSD < 7%) and accuracy (85-105% recovery), 
meeting regulatory requirements for environmental monitoring.

The NADES-SPME approach offers significant green chemistry advantages over 
traditional methods, eliminating organic solvent use entirely while providing 
2-3 fold improved extraction efficiency compared to commercial PDMS fibers. 
Over 100 extraction cycles, the fiber maintained stable performance, 
demonstrating practical viability for routine analysis.

This work expands both NADES applications and green SPME methodologies, 
demonstrating that naturally-derived solvents can serve as effective 
extraction phases. Future work will explore NADES diversity for broader 
analyte coverage and application to complex matrices such as wastewater 
and biological fluids."
