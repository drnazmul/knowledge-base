## 📝 RESPONSE LETTER STRUCTURE

### **Opening Paragraph:**

```
Dear Editor and Reviewers,

We thank you for the thorough and constructive review of our manuscript
"[Title]" (Manuscript ID: [XXX]). We have carefully addressed all reviewer
comments and believe the manuscript is significantly improved. Below we
provide point-by-point responses to each comment.

Changes to the manuscript are highlighted in blue text for your convenience.

We hope the revised manuscript is now suitable for publication in [Journal].

Sincerely,
Dr. Nazmul Alam
(on behalf of all authors)
```

### **Response Format (Point-by-Point):**

```
REVIEWER 1

Comment 1.1: "The authors claim this is the first NADES-SPME application,
but reference [X] also reported similar work."

Response: We thank the reviewer for this important point. We have revised
our claim to acknowledge reference [X]. The manuscript now states (page 3,
lines 45-48): "While [previous work] demonstrated NADES in extraction,
this work represents the first application of NADES-coated SPME fibers
specifically for pharmaceutical analysis in environmental waters..."

Additionally, we have added reference [X] to the introduction (new ref 12)
and discussed how our work differs in terms of [specifics].

Action: Text revised (page 3), reference added, discussion expanded (page 4).
```

## 💡 HOW TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT COMMENT TYPES

### **1. REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS:**

**Reviewer:** "Please test the method with real wastewater samples."

**If Feasible:**
```
Response: Excellent suggestion. We have now tested the method with three
real wastewater samples from [location]. Results are presented in new
Table 5 (page 12) and discussed on pages 12-13, lines 285-302. The method
showed good performance with recoveries of 82-98% despite the complex
matrix, demonstrating practical applicability.

Action: New experiments conducted, Table 5 added, text added pages 12-13.
```

**If Not Feasible:**
```
Response: We appreciate this suggestion. However, due to [specific reason:
e.g., current COVID restrictions on sample collection, unavailability of
equipment for wastewater processing], we are unable to include wastewater
samples in this study. We acknowledge this limitation in the revised
conclusion (page 15, lines 345-348) and propose it as important future work.

We did add tap water and river water samples (new Table 4) to better
demonstrate real sample applicability within current constraints.

Action: Limitation acknowledged, additional feasible samples added (Table 4).
```

### **2. CRITICISM OF DATA/INTERPRETATION:**

**Reviewer:** "The LOD of 0.1 ng/mL is not impressive compared to SPE."

**Response:**
```
Response: We thank the reviewer for this perspective. While SPE methods can
achieve slightly lower LODs (0.05 ng/mL, ref [X]), our method offers
advantages in terms of: (1) complete elimination of organic solvents
(SPE uses 10-20 mL dichloromethane), (2) shorter analysis time (30 min vs.
2 hours for SPE), and (3) lower cost ($0.50 vs. $5 per sample).

We have added Table 6 (page 13) providing comprehensive comparison of our
method vs. SPE and other extraction techniques, including LOD, solvent use,
time, and cost. The discussion now better emphasizes that green chemistry
benefits and practical advantages can outweigh small LOD differences when
LODs are sufficient for application (0.1 ng/mL meets regulatory requirements,
as noted on page 13, line 295).

Action: Table 6 added, discussion expanded and balanced.
```

### **3. CLARIFICATION REQUESTS:**

**Reviewer:** "How was the fiber coating thickness determined?"

**Response:**
```
Response: Thank you for seeking clarification. Coating thickness was
measured by SEM cross-sectional imaging of the fiber. We have added this
detail to the Methods section (page 6, lines 125-127) and included a
representative cross-section image in revised Figure 3c.

Action: Methods text clarified, Figure 3c added.
```

### **4. CONCERNS ABOUT STATISTICS:**

**Reviewer:** "No statistical analysis was performed comparing methods."

**Response:**
```
Response: We agree this is important. We have now performed one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey's post-hoc test comparing our NADES-SPME method with
commercial PDMS-SPME and SPE. Results show statistically significant
differences (p < 0.05) as noted in revised Figure 5 caption and discussed
on page 11, lines 245-250.

Action: Statistical analysis added, Figure 5 updated with significance
indicators, text added.
```

### **5. WRITING/CLARITY ISSUES:**

**Reviewer:** "The introduction is too long and unfocused."

**Response:**
```
Response: We have substantially revised and shortened the introduction
from 4 pages to 2.5 pages. The revised introduction now follows a clearer
structure: (1) problem statement (para 1), (2) current methods and
limitations (para 2-3), (3) NADES as solution (para 4), (4) our specific
objectives (para 5). Redundant information has been removed.

Action: Introduction revised and shortened (pages 2-4).
```

## ⚠️ DIFFICULT SITUATIONS

### **Reviewer Wants You to Cite Their Work:**

**Reviewer:** "The authors should cite [specific papers]."

**If Relevant:**
```
Response: Thank you for pointing out these relevant references. We have
added [citations] and discussed them in relation to our work on page [X].

Action: References added and discussed.
```

**If Not Relevant:**
```
Response: While we appreciate the suggested references, we respectfully
feel that [brief specific reason: e.g., these focus on different analytes
and matrices not directly comparable to our work]. However, we have added
reference [Y] which addresses [relevant aspect] that the reviewer may have
had in mind.

Action: Relevant reference added, irrelevant ones omitted with justification.
```

### **Conflicting Reviewer Opinions:**

**Reviewer 1:** "Add more detail to methods."  
**Reviewer 2:** "Methods section too long, move to SI."

**Response:**
```
Response to Reviewer 1 & 2: We appreciate both perspectives. To balance
these requests, we have kept essential methods in the main text for
reproducibility (Reviewer 1's concern) while moving detailed protocols
for fiber fabrication and optimization procedures to Supporting Information
(Reviewer 2's concern). This reduces main text length while maintaining
critical information accessibility.

Actions: Some methods moved to SI, main text streamlined but complete.
```

### **Reviewer Fundamentally Misunderstands:**

**Stay Professional:**
```
Response: We apologize if this was unclear in the original manuscript.
To clarify: [clear explanation]. We have revised the text on page [X],
lines [Y-Z] to better explain this point.

Action: Clarification added to prevent future misunderstanding.
```
