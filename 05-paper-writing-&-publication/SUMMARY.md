**When You Have Project 5 Set Up:**

```
You: I have data from my NADES-SPME pharmaceutical extraction study.
     Help me write the paper.

Claude: Great! Let's use the manuscript-writing-guide.md. First,
        let's organize your data into figures and tables...

[Claude guides you through complete paper writing process]

[2-3 weeks of collaboration later...]

Claude: Your manuscript is ready! Based on journal-selection-guide.md,
        I recommend submitting to Talanta. Here's why...
```

**Then After Review:**

```
You: I got major revision from Talanta. Here are the reviewer comments.
     Help me respond.

Claude: Excellent - major revision is good news! Let's use 
        reviewer-response-guide.md to craft professional responses...

[Claude helps you address each comment systematically]
