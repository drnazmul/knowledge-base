## 🎯 STRATEGY FOR YOUR NADES-SPME WORK

### **Paper 1: NADES-SPME Pharmaceutical Water**

**Primary Target:** Talanta or Analytica Chimica Acta
- Why: Solid fit, good IF, realistic acceptance
- Backup: Microchemical Journal

**Alternative (Higher Risk):** Analytical Chemistry
- Why: If data exceptional, go for top tier
- Risk: More competitive

**Alternative (NADES Focus):** Journal of Molecular Liquids
- Why: If emphasizing NADES properties
- Risk: Less visibility to analytical community

---

### **Paper 2: Single-Cell SPME (Sunway Collaboration)**

**Primary Target:** Analytical Chemistry
- Why: Novel application, biological significance
- Co-authors: Prof. Goh provides biological context
- Higher impact potential

**Backup:** Analytica Chimica Acta or Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry
- Why: Bioanalytical focus still valued

---

## 💰 OPEN ACCESS CONSIDERATIONS

**Traditional (Subscription):**
- No author fee
- Limited free access
- Available through university libraries

**Open Access:**
- Author pays ($1,500-$5,000 USD)
- Freely available to all
- Higher visibility/citations
- Check if university has agreements (discounts)

**Hybrid:**
- Traditional journal with OA option
- Pay for OA in subscription journal

**Your Considerations:**
- Funding available? (Some grants cover OA)
- Career stage? (Visibility important early career)
- Audience? (Industry readers may prefer OA)
