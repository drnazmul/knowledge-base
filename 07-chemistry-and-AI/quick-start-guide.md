haven't secured Monash position yet.
```

**Claude Will:**
- Assess timing (too early?)
- Consider academic career impact
- Provide alternatives (free review for testimonial?)
- Recommend approach

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

 

### **2. Consistency > Intensity**

**Better:**
- 3 good posts/week for 12 months
- 10 minutes daily engagement
- Steady, sustainable growth

**Not:**
- 10 posts one week, then silence
- Burst of activity, then burnout
- Inconsistent presence

**Key:** This is a marathon, not a sprint!

---

### **3. Authenticity is Your Superpower**

**What makes your content different:**
- ✅ Real stories (your Process Improvement, job search, transitions)
- ✅ Honest about failures ("What didn't work...")
- ✅ Specific numbers (not vague claims)
- ✅ Both sides shown (AI benefits AND limitations)
- ✅ Practical over motivational (templates > pep talks)

**Don't lose this as you grow!**

---

### **4. AI Focus = Differentiation**

**Most chemistry LinkedIn content is:**
- Generic career advice
- Lab equipment promotions
- Corporate announcements
- Research paper summaries

**YOUR content is:**
- AI + Chemistry (rare combination!)
- Practical tutorials (immediately useful)
- Honest reviews (not just hype)
- Real ROI stories (your $50K savings)

**This is your unique lane!**

---

### **5. Help First, Monetize Later**

**Phase 1 (NOW):**
- Give generously
- Build trust
- Establish expertise

---

### **❌ Mistake 5: Letting platform hurt academics**
- Spending 20 hours/week on LinkedIn
