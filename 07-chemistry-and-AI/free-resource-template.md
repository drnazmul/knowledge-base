━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ DO:
• Verify all chemistry facts (AI can hallucinate!)
• Customize prompts for your specific situation
• Iterate - follow up with "regenerate focusing on [aspect]"
• Copy-paste relevant data/context for better responses
• Use GPT-4 for technical accuracy (GPT-3.5 less reliable)

❌ DON'T:
• Trust AI blindly (especially for safety/regulatory)
• Use AI output verbatim without review
• Skip checking citations (AI invents papers!)
• Assume AI knows your lab's specific conditions
• Share confidential/proprietary information in prompts

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 PRO TIPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. BUILD ON RESPONSES
First prompt → get initial output → follow with:
"Expand section 2 with more detail"
"Make this more concise"
"Add specific example"
"Regenerate with focus on [aspect]"

2. PROVIDE CONTEXT
Better responses when you include:
• Your role/experience level
• Specific instrument/method details
• Constraints (time, budget, equipment)
• Target audience

3. SAVE GOOD PROMPTS
Create a personal "prompt library" of prompts that work well for YOUR 
workflows. Modify and reuse.

4. COMBINE WITH OTHER TOOLS
ChatGPT for ideation → [Perplexity for research] → [Python for analysis] 
→ [Notion AI for organization] = Complete workflow

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 FINAL ADVICE FROM DR. ALAM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. START EARLY
   PhD applications take 6-12 months of preparation.
   Don't rush!

2. RESEARCH THE ADVISOR
   This is MORE important than university ranking.
   Bad advisor = miserable PhD.

3. BE STRATEGIC
   Apply to 6-10 programs:
   • 2-3 "reach" (top choice)
   • 3-4 "match" (good fit)
   • 2-3 "safety" (likely acceptance)

4. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
   Better to apply to 6 programs with tailored materials
   than 15 with generic ones.

5. ASK FOR HELP
   Current PhD students are goldmines of information.
   Ask them EVERYTHING.

6. TRUST YOUR GUT
   If something feels off during interview/visit → trust it.
   You'll be there 5+ years!

7. HAVE A BACKUP PLAN
