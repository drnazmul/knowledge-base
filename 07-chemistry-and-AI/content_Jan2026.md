How ChatGPT saved me 2 hours on method development

Real example from my work at Deciem.

I needed to develop an LC-MS method for 5 cosmetic active ingredients in aqueous formulation.

Traditional approach:
- Literature review: 2-3 hours
- Trial and error: days
- Optimization: more days

What I did instead:

My ChatGPT Prompt: "I need to analyze retinol, niacinamide, ascorbic acid, hyaluronic acid, and peptides in water-based cosmetic formula using LC-MS/MS. Suggest: 1) Sample prep 2) Column 3) Mobile phase 4) Internal standards 5) Potential interferences"

Got in 2 minutes:

- Protein precipitation with acetonitrile
- C18 column, 2.1x50mm, 5μm
- Methanol/water with 0.1% formic acid gradient
- Deuterated analogs as internal standards
- Matrix effects warning (excipients, preservatives)

Perfect? No. 
Time saved? YES. 

Still needed my 14 years of expertise? Absolutely.

My new workflow:
- ChatGPT direction (15 min)
- Verify with literature (30 min vs 2 hrs)
- Test approach
- Optimize with my brain
- Time saved: 40-50% on planning

AI does not replace your chemistry knowledge, at least now. It accelerates the boring parts so you spend more time on what matters.

Are you using AI in your lab? What for?

P.S. This a dummy example, I can not disclose the actual formulation.
