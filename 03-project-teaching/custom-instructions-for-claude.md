QUESTION 1 [Multiple Choice - 1 point]
Which of the following best describes the principle of SPME?

A) Analytes dissolve in a liquid solvent
B) Analytes partition into a solid coating
C) Analytes are trapped in a membrane filter
D) Analytes react with a chemical reagent

CORRECT ANSWER: B

FEEDBACK (Correct): 
"Exactly! In SPME, analytes partition between the sample matrix and 
the solid coating on the fiber. This partition coefficient determines 
extraction efficiency."

FEEDBACK (Incorrect - A):
"Not quite. SPME is a solvent-free technique - that's one of its key 
advantages! The analytes partition into a solid coating, not a liquid."
