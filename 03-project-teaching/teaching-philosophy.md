## 🎓 MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

### **Core Belief**

I believe effective teaching in chemistry is not about transferring facts from instructor to student, but about **cultivating deep understanding, critical thinking, and the ability to apply knowledge to solve real-world problems**. As a senior lecturer, my role is to create learning environments where students don't just memorize principles—they understand WHY these principles matter, HOW to apply them, and WHEN to question conventional approaches.

---

## 🌟 GUIDING PRINCIPLES

### **1. Bridge Theory and Practice**

**The Principle:**
Chemistry education must connect fundamental concepts with real-world applications. Theory without application is abstract; application without theory is shallow.

**My Approach:**
Having spent 14 years bridging academic research (PhD from Prof. Janusz Pawliszyn's world-leading SPME lab) and industry R&D (Deciem, Dalriada), I bring authentic connections between classroom and real world.

**In Practice:**
- **Industry case studies:** When teaching green chemistry principles, I use real examples from my work—like reducing solvent use by 90% at Deciem, saving $50K annually
- **Real data:** Students analyze actual data from my research and industry projects, not sanitized textbook examples
- **Problem-based learning:** I present challenges I've faced ("how do you validate this method for FDA submission?") and guide students through solving them
- **Guest practitioners:** I bring industry professionals to share current challenges, giving students direct access to real-world problems

**Why This Works:**
Students see immediate relevance. They understand that green chemistry isn't just environmental idealism—it's sound business practice. When I say "this approach saved my company $50K," they pay attention differently than if I say "this is more sustainable."

---

### **2. Research-Led Teaching**

**The Principle:**
Master's-level education should be informed by current research. Students should learn not just established knowledge, but how knowledge is created.

**My Approach:**
My active research in NADES-based SPME and green analytical methods directly enriches my teaching. I don't just teach about green solvents—I'm actively developing them (USM collaboration). I don't just lecture on analytical method development—I've published 17 papers on it.

**In Practice:**
- **Current research integration:** When discussing NADES, I share preliminary data from my current USM collaboration. Students see research in progress, not just finished results
- **Research thinking:** I teach students to ask research questions: "What if we tried...?" "How could we improve...?" "Why does this work this way?"
- **Student research projects:** Outstanding students can extend my research. This isn't just pedagogical—it's genuine research contribution
- **Literature engagement:** I assign recent papers, including some I've authored. Students learn to read primary literature critically

**Example:**
In my Green Chemistry course, Week 3 covers NADES. Instead of just explaining theory, I show students my actual research:
- Here's the NADES we synthesized at USM
- Here's how we're testing it for SPME coatings
- Here's preliminary data (with uncertainties)
- Here's what we're trying next
- Here's where YOU could contribute

This authenticity is impossible to fake. Students sense the difference between "teaching about research" and "teaching FROM research."

**Why This Works:**
Research-led teaching models scientific thinking. Students see that knowledge isn't static—it's constantly evolving. They learn to engage with uncertainty, a critical skill for Master's-level graduates.

### **3. Student-Centered Active Learning**

**The Principle:**
Students learn best by DOING, not by passive listening. My role is to design experiences where students construct understanding through active engagement.

**My Approach:**
I use the **flipped classroom model** (aligned with Monash pedagogy):
- **Before class:** Students watch videos, read materials, complete formative quizzes
- **In class:** We apply, analyze, evaluate, create—the higher-order thinking that requires guidance
- **After class:** Students extend learning through meaningful assignments

**In Practice:**

**Pre-Class (Online):**
- Short videos (10-15 min) I create, explaining core concepts
- Readings (journal articles, case studies)
- Formative quizzes (for learning, not grading)
- Discussion board questions

**In-Class (Face-to-Face):**
- **No lectures!** (content delivered pre-class)
- Problem-solving workshops
- Case study analysis in groups
- Laboratory experiments (inquiry-based, not cookbook)
- Discussions and debates
- Peer teaching opportunities

**Example Class Structure (Week 3, Green Solvents):**

*Pre-Class:*
- Watch: "NADES Introduction" video (12 min)
- Read: 2015 paper on NADES applications (Dai et al.)
- Quiz: Basic NADES properties (formative)

*In-Class (2 hours):*
- 0-10 min: Quick Q&A on pre-class material (address confusions)
- 10-40 min: Group work: "Design a NADES for extracting caffeine from coffee"
  - Each group gets different hydrogen bond donor/acceptor options
  - Calculate predicted properties
  - Present reasoning
- 40-70 min: Demonstration: I synthesize one NADES live
  - Students observe, ask questions
  - Discuss properties, safety, cost
- 70-90 min: Workshop: Evaluate 5 solvents (traditional organic, ionic liquid, 3 NADES)
  - Environmental impact (GAPI score)
  - Cost analysis
  - Safety assessment
  - Performance prediction
- 90-120 min: Discussion: When to use which? Trade-offs?

*Post-Class:*
- Individual assignment: Propose NADES for specific application with justification
- Peer review two classmates' proposals
- Refine based on feedback

**Why This Works:**
Students remember what they DO far better than what they HEAR. By making class time active, I ensure maximum learning per contact hour. The pre-class content delivery frees class time for deep engagement.

### **4. Inclusive Excellence**

**The Principle:**
All students can achieve excellence, but they may need different pathways. My responsibility is to design learning experiences that support diverse learners while maintaining high standards.

**My Approach:**
I design courses with multiple entry points and pathways to success, accommodating different learning styles, backgrounds, and life circumstances.

**In Practice:**

**Diverse Assessment Methods:**
Not just exams—students demonstrate learning through:
- Written reports (for reflective learners)
- Oral presentations (for verbal learners)
- Laboratory work (for kinesthetic learners)
- Projects (for creative learners)
- Quizzes (for those who excel with structured testing)

This isn't about making courses easier—it's about letting students show mastery in multiple ways. A student who struggles with exams might excel in projects.

**Scaffolded Learning:**
I build complexity gradually:
- Week 1: Foundation concepts (remember, understand)
- Weeks 2-4: Application to simple cases
- Weeks 5-8: Analysis of complex scenarios
- Weeks 9-12: Synthesis and creation

By the end, all students reach Master's-level work, but the scaffold supports them getting there.

**International Student Support:**
At Monash Malaysia, many students are international. I:
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Provide examples from diverse cultural contexts
- Avoid idioms that don't translate
- Offer multiple ways to ask for help (in-person, online, peer)

**Accommodations:**
I work proactively with student support services for students with:
- Learning differences
- Physical disabilities
- Mental health challenges
- Family/work commitments

Alternative assessment timelines, formats, or methods when needed—while maintaining academic integrity and learning outcomes.

**Why This Works:**
Inclusion isn't about lowering standards—it's about removing unnecessary barriers. When I accommodate diverse learners, MORE students achieve excellence, not fewer.

### **5. Develop Industry-Ready Graduates**

**The Principle:**
Master's graduates should be ready for professional practice—whether in industry, research, or further study. Academic excellence must translate to practical competence.

**My Approach:**
I explicitly teach professional skills alongside chemistry content, preparing graduates for careers beyond the classroom.

**Professional Skills I Develop:**

**Communication:**
- Scientific writing (lab reports, case studies, project reports)
- Oral presentation (formal presentations, informal discussions)
- Visual communication (data visualization, poster design)
- Technical documentation (SOPs, protocols)
- Non-technical communication (explaining chemistry to non-chemists)

**Collaboration:**
- Group projects with defined roles
- Peer review and feedback
- Cross-disciplinary communication
- Conflict resolution in teams

**Problem-Solving:**
- Not just solving pre-defined problems, but identifying problems
- Working with incomplete information
- Iterative refinement of solutions
- Learning from failures

**Regulatory Literacy:**
- Understanding compliance (my FDA/cGMP experience)
- Documentation requirements
- Quality assurance thinking
- Risk assessment

**Lifelong Learning:**
- How to find and evaluate information
- Keeping current in a rapidly evolving field
- Adapting to new techniques and tools
- Self-directed learning

**In Practice:**

**Green Chemistry Course Example:**
Beyond chemistry content, students develop:
- **Project management:** Major project with timeline, milestones, deliverables
- **Cost-benefit analysis:** Every "green" solution includes economic evaluation
- **Stakeholder communication:** Present to "management" (role-play) justifying green alternatives
- **Regulatory awareness:** FDA, EPA, DOE requirements integrated throughout
- **Ethical reasoning:** Discuss trade-offs (e.g., bio-based feedstocks vs. food security)

**Industry Connections:**
- Guest lectures from practitioners (pharmaceutical, cosmetics, environmental sectors)
- Industry-proposed projects when possible
- Site visits to companies (if feasible)
- Career panels and networking

**My Industry Experience as Resource:**
I share authentic experiences:
- "When we faced this problem at Deciem, here's what we did..."
- "In my Dalriada work, FDA required..."
- "The cost calculation we used was..."
- "My mistake was... here's what I learned..."

**Why This Works:**
Graduates aren't just knowledgeable—they're capable. They can walk into a job and contribute from day one. Employers recognize this and hire Monash graduates preferentially.

## 🎯 TEACHING IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY CONTEXT

### **Unique Considerations**

**Teaching green chemistry is different** because:

**1. It's Intrinsically Interdisciplinary**
Green chemistry sits at the intersection of:
- Chemistry (obviously)
- Environmental science
- Economics
- Engineering
- Policy
- Ethics

I embrace this complexity. My course design deliberately spans these domains, requiring students to think beyond pure chemistry.

**2. It Challenges "How We've Always Done It"**
Green chemistry often questions traditional practices. This can be uncomfortable—but it's where deep learning happens. I create safe spaces for students to:
- Question established methods
- Challenge industry norms (respectfully)
- Imagine alternatives
- Evaluate trade-offs honestly

**3. It Requires Systems Thinking**
Green chemistry isn't about optimizing one variable—it's about considering whole systems. I teach students to:
- Consider life cycles, not just reactions
- Evaluate multiple criteria simultaneously (environment, cost, safety, performance)
- Accept that there's rarely one "right" answer
- Justify choices with evidence and reasoning

**4. It Has Immediate Real-World Relevance**
Every concept we cover has industrial application. I leverage this:
- Current events and news (chemical spills, regulatory changes, innovations)
- Industry trends (shift to bio-based, circular economy)
- Malaysian context (local industries, opportunities, challenges)
- Student career aspirations (what will YOU do with this?)

## 📊 ASSESSING LEARNING

### **Assessment Philosophy**

**Assessment FOR Learning, Not Just OF Learning**

**Formative Assessment (For Learning):**
- Frequent, low-stakes
- Provides feedback for improvement
- Students learn from mistakes without penalty
- Examples: Online quizzes, draft reports, peer review

**Summative Assessment (Of Learning):**
- Demonstrates achievement
- Contributes to grade
- Multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery
- Examples: Final exam, major project, case study

**Assessment AS Learning:**
- Students reflect on their own understanding
- Metacognition develops
- Self-regulation improves
- Examples: Learning journals, self-assessment, goal-setting

---

### **Assessment Design Principles**

**1. Aligned with Outcomes**
Every assessment maps clearly to learning outcomes. Students know WHY they're doing each assessment and WHAT it measures.

**2. Authentic**
Assessments mirror real-world tasks:
- Case study analysis → What industry practitioners do
- Project report → Real deliverable in professional contexts
- Presentation → Necessary skill for any career
- Laboratory work → Actual research/industry practice

**3. Progressive**
Difficulty increases across semester:
- Early assessments: Apply concepts to simple cases
- Mid-semester: Analyze complex scenarios
- Late semester: Synthesize and create novel solutions

**4. Transparent**
Students receive:
- Clear rubrics (before submitting)
- Exemplars (what good work looks like)
- Feedback (specific, actionable, timely)
- Opportunities to improve

**5. Fair**
- Criteria based on learning outcomes, not arbitrary preferences
- Moderation (consistency across markers if multiple)
- Accommodations for documented needs
- No surprises (what's assessed was taught and practiced)

---

## 🌱 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### **Reflective Practice**

**I Am a Learner Too**

Teaching is a skill that develops through practice and reflection. I continuously improve through:

**Student Feedback:**
- Mid-semester informal feedback (what's working? what's not?)
- End-semester formal evaluation
- Individual conversations
- Anonymous suggestion channels

**Peer Observation:**
- Colleagues observe my teaching
- I observe others
- We share insights and strategies

**Scholarship of Teaching:**
