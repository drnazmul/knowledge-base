## TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE TEACHING MATERIALS

### ✅ DO:
- **Start with Learning Outcomes:** Everything aligns to these
- **Use Active Voice:** "Calculate the partition coefficient" not "The partition coefficient should be calculated"
- **Provide Examples:** Real-world applications, not just theory
- **Scaffold Learning:** Start simple, build complexity
- **Give Feedback:** Always explain why answers are right/wrong
- **Test Materials:** Try quiz yourself, time activities

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Overload Content:** One concept per video/activity
- **Assume Prior Knowledge:** Explicitly state prerequisites
- **Use Jargon Without Explanation:** Define technical terms
- **Create Passive Activities:** Students should be doing, not just listening
- **Forget Assessment:** How will you know if they learned?
- **Ignore Accessibility:** Captions, alt text, clear fonts

---

## VIDEO RECORDING TIPS

### Equipment Setup:
- **Microphone:** Essential for clear audio (Lavalier or USB mic)
- **Lighting:** Face well-lit, avoid shadows
- **Background:** Clean, professional, not distracting
- **Camera:** 1080p minimum, eye level

### Software Recommendations:
- **Recording:** OBS Studio (free), Camtasia, Screencast-O-Matic
- **Editing:** DaVinci Resolve (free), Adobe Premiere, iMovie
- **Slides:** PowerPoint, Google Slides with animations
- **Screen Recording:** OBS, QuickTime, Windows Game Bar

### Recording Best Practices:
- Record in quiet environment
- Do test recording first
- Record in segments (easier to edit)
- Save project files (can revise later)
- Export in high quality (1080p, 60fps ideal)

- Video completion rates (YouTube Analytics)
- Quiz completion rates (learning platform)
- Time on task (activity completion times)

### Qualitative Feedback:
- Mid-course surveys
- End-of-course evaluations
- Focus groups
- One-on-one student interviews
- Peer observation

### Iterate Based on Data:
- If quiz scores low → Revise video or add examples
- If activity too long → Simplify or provide more structure
- If engagement low → Add more interactive elements
- If confusion common → Create supplementary materials
