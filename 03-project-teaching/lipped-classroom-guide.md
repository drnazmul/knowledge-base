# Flipped Classroom Implementation Guide

**Monash-Aligned Pedagogy for Green Chemistry**

**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## 🎯 OVERVIEW

This guide outlines my approach to implementing flipped classroom pedagogy in the Green & Sustainable Chemistry course, aligned with Monash University's teaching philosophy.

**What is Flipped Classroom:**
- Content delivery BEFORE class (videos, readings)
- Class time for application, analysis, creation (higher-order thinking)
- Instructor as facilitator, not lecturer
- Student-centered active learning

**Why Flipped:**
- ✅ Maximizes face-to-face time for deep learning
- ✅ Allows students to learn at own pace (video can be paused/replayed)
- ✅ Frees class for activities that REQUIRE instructor presence
- ✅ Develops independent learning skills
- ✅ Proven effectiveness for complex concepts

## 📋 THREE-PHASE STRUCTURE

### **PHASE 1: PRE-CLASS (Online - Individual)**

**Purpose:** Deliver foundational content, prepare for in-class application

**Components:**

**1. Video Lectures (10-15 min each)**
- Short, focused on one concept
- High-quality visuals
- Engaging delivery
- Embedded questions for checking understanding
- Closed captions for accessibility

**2. Reading Materials**
- Textbook chapters (targeted sections)
- Journal articles (primary literature when appropriate)
- Case studies for discussion
- Supplementary resources

**3. Formative Assessments**
- Online quizzes (auto-graded)
- Discussion board prompts
- Pre-class worksheets
- Concept maps or diagrams

**4. Expected Student Time:** 2-3 hours/week

**Platform:** Moodle (Monash LMS)

---

### **PHASE 2: IN-CLASS (Face-to-Face - Collaborative)**

**Purpose:** Apply knowledge, develop skills, engage deeply with material

**NO LECTURES!** Class time reserved for:

**Active Learning Strategies:**

**1. Problem-Based Learning (30-40 min blocks)**
- Real industry problems
- Groups design solutions
- Present and defend choices
- Peer critique

**2. Case Study Analysis (30-40 min)**
- Analyze real implementations
- Evaluate successes/failures
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Recommend improvements

**3. Laboratory Inquiry (2-3 hour blocks)**
- Not cookbook - students design experiments
- Compare approaches (green vs. traditional)
- Troubleshoot and iterate
- Analyze results critically

**4. Workshops (20-30 min)**
- Calculations and quantitative analysis
- Group problem-solving
- Peer teaching
- Hands-on activities

**5. Discussions & Debates (15-20 min)**
- Controversial topics (e.g., bio-based feedstocks vs. food)
- Ethical considerations
- Trade-off decisions
- Multiple perspectives

**6. Guest Lectures (Occasional)**
- Industry practitioners share real challenges
- Interactive Q&A, not passive lecture
- Connection to class content

**My Role:**
- Facilitate, don't dominate
- Ask probing questions
- Provide feedback in real-time
- Ensure all students engaged
- Clarify confusions
- Connect activities to learning outcomes

---

### **PHASE 3: POST-CLASS (Independent - Application)**

**Purpose:** Extend learning, practice skills, prepare for assessment

**Activities:**

**1. Assignments**
- Apply concepts to new situations
- Develop solutions to complex problems
- Written reports
- Calculations and analysis

**2. Projects**
- Longer-term application
- Integration of multiple concepts
- Independent work with milestones
- Professional-quality deliverables

**3. Reflection**
- Learning journals
- Self-assessment
- Goal-setting
- Metacognition

**4. Peer Review**
- Give feedback on others' work
- Develop critical evaluation skills
- Learn from peers
- Improve own work

**5. Preparation for Next Week**
- Reading/viewing for upcoming topic
- Background research
- Questions formulated

## 🎥 VIDEO LECTURE CREATION

### **Best Practices:**

**Content:**
- One concept per video (focused)
- 10-15 minutes maximum (attention span)
- Clear learning objective stated upfront
- Examples and visuals emphasized
- Summary at end

**Production:**
- Screen recording with voice-over for concepts
- Document camera for calculations/examples
- Simple editing (cuts, not fancy effects)
- Professional but authentic (not overproduced)

**Engagement:**
- Embedded questions at key points
- Prompts to pause and try
- Enthusiasm and energy in delivery
- Connect to real-world applications

**Accessibility:**
- Closed captions (auto-generated, then edited)
- Clear audio quality
- High-contrast visuals
- Alternatives for images (text descriptions)

**Platform:** Record using Panopto or Zoom, upload to Moodle

## 📊 ASSESSMENT IN FLIPPED MODEL

### **Formative Assessment (For Learning):**

**Pre-Class:**
- Online quizzes (check understanding before class)
- Discussion board (evaluate thinking)
- Self-assessment checklists

**In-Class:**
- Observation during activities
- Quick checks for understanding
- Group work monitoring
- Exit tickets (what did you learn today?)

**Post-Class:**
- Assignment drafts with feedback
- Practice problems
- Peer review

**Purpose:** Identify gaps, provide feedback, guide improvement (NOT for grading)

---

### **Summative Assessment (Of Learning):**

**Alignment with Flipped Approach:**
- Assessments test application, not just recall
- Projects and case studies (mirror in-class activities)
- Laboratory reports (extend hands-on work)
- Exams include complex problem-solving
- No "gotcha" questions—assess what was practiced

**Fair Assessment:**
- Students practiced skills in class before being assessed
- Rubrics shared in advance
- Exemplars provided
- No surprises

---

## 💡 STUDENT SUPPORT

### **Challenges Students May Face:**

**Time Management:**
- Pre-class work requires discipline
- Need to plan ahead
- Balancing with other commitments

**My Support:**
- Clear schedules and deadlines
- Reminders and nudges
- Flexible timing (videos available anytime)
- Office hours for struggling students

---

**Technical Issues:**
- Video won't play
- Internet connectivity problems
- Platform difficulties

**My Support:**
- Alternative formats (transcripts, readings)
- Offline access where possible
- Technical help resources
- Grace period for technical problems

---

**Learning Preferences:**
- Some students prefer traditional lectures
- May resist active learning initially
- Discomfort with ambiguity

**My Support:**
- Explain WHY flipped (evidence of effectiveness)
- Gradual transition (scaffold activities)
- Support during adjustment
- Patience and encouragement

---

## 📈 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### **Monitoring Effectiveness:**

**What I'll Track:**
- Pre-class quiz completion rates (are students doing it?)
- Pre-class quiz performance (do they understand?)
- In-class engagement levels (are they participating?)
- Assignment quality (can they apply?)
- Student feedback (what's working? what's not?)

**Adjustments:**
- If pre-class completion low → Adjust timing, remind, incentivize
- If quiz performance poor → Revise videos, add support
- If class participation low → Redesign activities, vary approaches
- If learning outcomes not met → Increase practice, provide more feedback

## 🌟 WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS FOR GREEN CHEMISTRY

**Particularly Suited Because:**

✅ **Complex Concepts:** Green metrics, LCA, systems thinking benefit from in-class application
✅ **Multiple Perspectives:** Trade-offs and decisions require discussion
✅ **Hands-On Skills:** Laboratory work and calculations need practice with feedback
✅ **Real-World Application:** Industry problems ideal for case-based learning
✅ **Master's Level:** Higher-order thinking is the goal—perfect for flipped model

---

**This flipped approach aligns with Monash pedagogy, research on effective learning, and my teaching philosophy of student-centered, active engagement.**

---

**Ready for implementation in Green & Sustainable Chemistry course.**
