## 📝 STUDY GUIDES

### **12 Principles of Green Chemistry - Quick Reference:**

1. **Waste Prevention** - Better not to make waste than clean it up
2. **Atom Economy** - Maximize incorporation of reactants into product
3. **Less Hazardous Synthesis** - Use/generate substances with little toxicity
4. **Designing Safer Chemicals** - Preserve function while reducing toxicity
5. **Safer Solvents** - Avoid auxiliary substances when possible
6. **Energy Efficiency** - Minimize energy requirements
7. **Renewable Feedstocks** - Use renewable rather than depleting raw materials
8. **Reduce Derivatives** - Minimize protecting groups and temporary modifications
9. **Catalysis** - Catalytic reagents superior to stoichiometric
10. **Design for Degradation** - Products should break down safely
11. **Real-time Analysis** - Monitor to prevent pollution
12. **Inherently Safer Chemistry** - Minimize potential for accidents

### **SPME Quick Reference:**

**Fiber Selection Guide:**
- PDMS: Non-polar compounds (hydrocarbons, PAHs)
- PA: Polar compounds (phenols, nitroaromatics)
- PDMS/DVB: Volatile compounds, alcohols
- CAR/PDMS: Gases, volatile organics
- CW/DVB: Polar analytes, amines

**Optimization Variables:**
- Extraction time (equilibrium vs. kinetic)
- Temperature (affects partition and diffusion)
- pH (for ionizable compounds)
- Ionic strength (salting-out effect)
- Agitation (mass transfer)
- Desorption time and temperature
