---

### **SESSION PLAN**

---

## **SEGMENT 1: Quick Check & Connect (10 min)**

### **Objectives:**
- Ensure students did pre-class work
- Address common confusions from quiz
- Activate prior knowledge
- Set expectations for session

### **Activity: Think-Pair-Share**

**My Opening:**
"Welcome! Before we dive into NADES applications today, let's make sure we're all on the same page. Take 30 seconds to think silently: What's the single most important property that makes NADES 'green'?"

**Process:**
1. **Think (30 sec):** Individual reflection
2. **Pair (2 min):** Turn to neighbor, discuss, come to agreement
3. **Share (3 min):** Call on 4-5 pairs, list answers on board

**Likely Answers:**
- Biodegradable
- Non-toxic
- From renewable sources
- Low vapor pressure
- No harsh chemicals

**My Response:**
"All correct! Notice there's no single 'most important'—greenness is multifaceted. Today we'll learn to evaluate THESE properties quantitatively for specific applications."

### **Address Quiz Confusions (4 min)**

**From Pre-Class Quiz Results:**
"I noticed 60% of you missed Question 7 about melting point depression. Let's clarify..."

[Quick explanation with visual]

"Any lingering questions from the pre-class materials before we apply these concepts?"

**Take 2-3 questions, keep brief**

---

## **SEGMENT 2: NADES Design Challenge (30 min)**

### **Objectives:**
- Apply knowledge of NADES composition
- Practice molecular reasoning
- Develop design thinking
- Collaborate in teams

### **Activity: Design a NADES**

**My Setup:**
"You work for a pharmaceutical company extracting a bioactive compound from plants. Current method uses methanol—expensive, toxic, generates waste. Your job: Design a NADES alternative."

**The Challenge:**
"Your target molecule is moderately polar, has hydroxyl groups, molecular weight ~250. You need to extract from dried plant material at room temperature."

**Group Task (20 min):**

**Each group gets:**
- Envelope with component cards:
  - HBA options: Choline chloride, betaine, proline
  - HBD options: Glucose, fructose, citric acid, urea, glycerol
  - Property reference sheet
  - Calculation worksheet

**Instructions:**
1. Choose HBA and HBD combination
2. Determine molar ratio (1:1, 1:2, 2:1, etc.)
3. Calculate mass needed to make 100g NADES
4. Predict properties (polarity, viscosity, stability)
5. Justify your design (Why these components? Why this ratio?)

**Worksheet Guides Them:**
- Consider: Polarity matching with target
- Consider: Viscosity for practical use
- Consider: Cost and availability
- Consider: Safety and environmental profile
- Consider: Stability (won't crystallize)

**My Role During Group Work:**
- Circulate to all groups
- Ask probing questions (not give answers):
  - "Why did you choose glucose over citric acid?"
  - "How will that ratio affect viscosity?"
  - "What's your reasoning for 2:1 instead of 1:2?"
- Provide hints if groups are stuck
- Ensure all group members participating

**Common Issues to Address:**
- Groups choosing incompatible components → "Check the hydrogen bonding capability..."
- Not considering practical properties → "Think about actually using this in a lab—what would be challenging?"
- Forgetting about cost → "This is industry—economics matter!"

---

**Group Presentations (10 min total):**

**Format:**
Each group has 90 seconds at their table to present (I rotate, others listen):
- "Our NADES: [Components] at [ratio]"
- "We chose this because..."
- "Predicted properties:"
- "Potential challenges:"

**I Take Notes:** Record designs on board for comparison

**Class Observations (3 min):**
"Looking at all designs, what patterns do you notice?"
- Most chose choline chloride (why? It's versatile and well-studied)
- Ratios varied (what's the impact?)
- Trade-offs evident (low viscosity vs. high polarity)

**Key Teaching Moment:**
"Notice there's NO single 'correct' answer. Real engineering involves trade-offs. Your job is to justify choices with evidence and reasoning."

---

## **SEGMENT 3: Live NADES Synthesis Demonstration (20 min)**

### **Objectives:**
- See actual NADES preparation
- Observe physical properties
- Discuss practical considerations
- Connect theory to practice

### **My Demonstration Setup:**

**Safety First:**
"Even though NADES are safer than organic solvents, we still follow proper protocols..."
[PPE, fume hood, proper labeling]

### **Synthesis:**

**Recipe:** Choline chloride : Glucose (1:2 molar ratio)

**Process (I narrate while doing):**

**Step 1: Weighing (5 min)**
"I'm weighing 13.96g choline chloride and 36.04g glucose for 50g total NADES. Let's verify this ratio is correct..."
[Show calculation on document camera]

**Students help:** "Can someone calculate the moles of each component? Does my 1:2 ratio check out?"
[Student does calculation on board]

**Step 2: Mixing (5 min)**
"I'm adding both to beaker and stirring. Watch what happens..."
[Heat gently to 80°C with stirring]

**Running Commentary:**
- "Notice it's not dissolving immediately—these are solid components forming a liquid mixture. The eutectic phenomenon is fascinating..."
- "Temperature helps, but we could do this at room temperature (just takes longer)"
- "See how viscous it's becoming? That's a NADES characteristic we need to consider for applications"

**Step 3: Cooling & Testing (5 min)**
"Now we cool to room temperature and test properties..."

**Tests (students observe):**
- pH test: "Approximately neutral—important for stability"
- Viscosity demonstration: "More viscous than water, less than honey—affects pumping, stirring"
- Stability: "We'll leave this at room temperature for weeks—it won't crystallize"

**Step 4: Comparison (5 min)**
"Let's compare to methanol (our original solvent)..."

**Side-by-Side:**
| Property | Methanol | Our NADES |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Toxicity | High (LD50: 5628 mg/kg) | Low (components are food-grade) |
| Vapor Pressure | High (evaporates readily) | Negligible (no VOC emissions) |
| Flammability | High (flashpoint 11°C) | Non-flammable |
| Cost | ~$50/L | ~$5/L (components) |
| Biodegradability | Moderate | Excellent |
| Viscosity | Low (0.59 cP) | High (~200 cP) |

**Discussion:**
"What do you observe?"
- [Students note]: NADES wins on safety, environmental, cost
- [Students note]: But loses on viscosity (practical challenge)

"This is REAL green chemistry—not perfect, but significantly better with manageable trade-offs."

## **SEGMENT 4: Real Research Data (My USM Collaboration) (20 min)**

### **Objectives:**
- See research in action
- Understand research process
- Connect classroom to cutting-edge work
- Inspire potential student projects

### **My Introduction:**

"Now I want to share my current research with Dr. Nur Nadhirah at USM. This is active, ongoing work—not textbook examples. You're seeing research as it happens."

### **Research Context:**

**Project:** NADES-based SPME coatings for green analytical chemistry

**Why:** Traditional SPME coatings (PDMS, polyacrylate) are synthetic polymers. Can we use NADES for greener alternative?

**My Role:** SPME expertise, method development
**Dr. Nur's Role:** NADES synthesis and characterization

### **Show Real Data (Slides):**

**Slide 1: NADES Formulations Tested**
[Table showing 8 different NADES we've synthesized]
- Choline chloride : Glucose (1:2)
- Choline chloride : Citric acid (1:1)
- Betaine : Glycerol (1:3)
- etc.

"We're systematically testing different formulations. Notice the variation in HBA, HBD, and ratios—this is experimental design in action."

**Slide 2: Coating Methods**
[Photos of SPME fibers with NADES coatings]
"Challenge: How do we immobilize liquid NADES on fiber surface? We're testing three approaches..."
[Describe methods briefly]

**Slide 3: Preliminary Results**
[Graph: Extraction efficiency vs. NADES type]

"This is real data from last month. Notice:"
- Choline-glucose shows best efficiency (but high viscosity)
- Betaine-glycerol has lower efficiency (but easier to coat)
- Some formulations didn't work at all

"What would you try next based on these results?"
[Take student suggestions—this is authentic research thinking]

**Slide 4: Challenges We're Facing**
- Coating stability (some NADES wash off during extraction)
- Reproducibility (coating thickness varies)
- Long-term stability (does NADES degrade over time?)

"These are REAL problems we're working on RIGHT NOW. No textbook has the answers yet."

### **Connection to Course:**

"This research embodies several green chemistry principles:"
- **Principle 5:** Safer solvents (NADES vs. synthetic polymers)
- **Principle 7:** Renewable feedstocks (all components from biomass)
- **Principle 10:** Design for degradation (NADES are biodegradable)

"And it shows green chemistry isn't just theoretical—it's advancing through research you could contribute to."

### **Student Opportunity:**

"Outstanding Master's students can extend this work for projects. Potential topics:"
- Test additional NADES formulations
- Optimize coating method
- Apply to specific analytes
- Economic analysis

"This is how research-led teaching works—you learn FROM active research, not just ABOUT finished research."

## **SEGMENT 5: Industry Application Case Study (20 min)**

### **Objectives:**
- Apply NADES knowledge to real industrial problem
- Develop cost-benefit analysis skills
- Practice stakeholder communication
- Understand implementation barriers

### **Case Study: Cosmetics Industry**

**My Introduction:**
"Now let's apply what we've learned. I'll share a real scenario from my time at Deciem (The Ordinary)..."

### **The Scenario:**

**Background:**
- Natural cosmetics company, emphasis on clean ingredients
- Quality control lab analyzes products daily (active ingredients, contaminants, stability)
- Current extraction method: Ethanol-based (for natural product analysis)
- Problem: High solvent costs, waste disposal issues, safety concerns

**The Data:**
- Lab uses 200L ethanol/month
- Cost: $50/L = $10,000/month on solvent alone
- Disposal: Additional $3,000/month
- Safety incidents: 2 minor spills/year
- Regulatory: Stricter VOC regulations coming

**The Request:**
Management asks: "Can we switch to something greener? What are the options and trade-offs?"

### **Group Activity (15 min):**

**Task:**
Your group is the R&D team. Prepare recommendation for management:

1. **Technical Assessment:**
   - Can NADES replace ethanol for this application?
   - Which NADES would you test?
   - What are technical risks?

2. **Economic Analysis:**
   - Cost comparison (NADES vs. ethanol)
   - Implementation costs (equipment, training, validation)
   - Payback period

3. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Phase 1: What to test first?
   - Timeline: How fast can you transition?
   - Risk mitigation: What could go wrong?

4. **Management Pitch:**
   - One slide summary (you'll present to "management")
   - Focus: ROI, risk, timeline

**Materials Provided:**
- Cost data for NADES components
- Equipment requirements
- Regulatory information
- Template for business case

**My Role:**
- Act as technical advisor when groups ask questions
- Push them to quantify (not just say "it's greener"—HOW MUCH greener?)
- Ensure they consider implementation realities

### **Presentations (5 min total):**

**Format:** One group presents to class as "management"
[I role-play as CEO, asking tough questions]

**Sample Dialogue:**

*Group:* "We recommend switching to choline chloride-glycerol NADES..."

*Me (as CEO):* "How much will this cost upfront? When do we break even?"

*Group:* "Initial investment is $30K for... we break even in 18 months..."

*Me:* "What if it doesn't work? What's our fallback?"

*Group:* "We propose pilot study first with just one product line..."

*Me:* "Okay, I like the conservative approach. What's the timeline?"

**Teaching Moment (After Role-Play):**

"Notice what happened: Technical feasibility alone isn't enough. You need business case, risk assessment, implementation plan. This is real-world green chemistry—it's as much about communication and business as it is about chemistry."

**Facilitate Discussion (10 min):**

**Students might say:**
- "NADES are greener but not perfect"
- "Design requires trade-offs"
- "Implementation has practical challenges"
- "Green chemistry needs business case"

**I Add/Emphasize:**
- "NADES represent 21st-century thinking: designed from natural components for specific functions"
- "They're not miracle solvents—they have limitations (viscosity, sometimes hygroscopic, limited data)"
- "But they open new possibilities—especially in extraction, catalysis, formulation"
- "The field is young—opportunities for innovation"

### **Connections to Course:**

"Today we focused on Principle 5 (Safer Solvents). Notice how it connected to:"
- **Principle 1:** Waste prevention (less solvent = less waste)
- **Principle 7:** Renewable feedstocks (NADES from biomass)
- **Principle 10:** Design for degradation (biodegradable)
- **Principle 12:** Inherently safer (low toxicity, non-flammable)

"This interconnection is typical—green chemistry principles reinforce each other."

### **Preview Next Week:**

"Next week: Principle 6 (Energy Efficiency) and Principle 9 (Catalysis). We'll see how green chemistry can reduce energy consumption and how catalysis enables sustainable processes."

"Connection to today: NADES can be used as catalytic media—combining safer solvents with catalysis. Stay tuned!"
