## QUIZ CREATION BEST PRACTICES

### Question Writing Tips:
✅ **DO:**
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Test understanding, not memorization
- Include plausible wrong answers
- Provide explanatory feedback
- Mix difficulty levels
- Align to specific learning objectives

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use "all of the above" or "none of the above"
- Make questions tricky or deceptive
- Use negative wording (avoid "NOT" unless bold)
- Create overly long questions
- Test trivial details

### Feedback Guidelines:
- **Correct Answer:** Reinforce why it's right, add context
- **Incorrect Answer:** Explain misconception, point to video section
- **Hints:** Give partial credit, nudge toward right thinking

---

## IN-CLASS ACTIVITY DESIGN TIPS

### Activity Structure:
1. **Introduction (2-3 min):** Explain activity purpose and instructions
2. **Individual/Group Work (15-30 min):** Students engage with material
3. **Sharing/Discussion (5-10 min):** Groups present, class discusses
4. **Debrief (2-5 min):** Summarize learning, connect to next topic

### Making Activities Engaging:
- Real-world scenarios (not hypothetical)
- Clear roles in group work
- Tangible deliverable (worksheet, presentation)
- Time pressure (keeps energy up)
- Competition element (if appropriate)
- Instructor circulates and facilitates

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
❌ Instructions unclear → Students confused, waste time
❌ Too long → Students lose focus
❌ Too easy → Students bored
❌ Too hard → Students frustrated
❌ No debrief → Learning points lost

## MEASURING TEACHING EFFECTIVENESS

### Video Metrics (YouTube Analytics):
- [ ] **Views:** How many people watched?
- [ ] **Watch Time:** Did they watch the full video?
- [ ] **Engagement:** Likes, comments, shares?
- [ ] **Traffic Source:** How did they find the video?
- [ ] **Demographics:** Who's watching (students, professionals)?

### Learning Metrics:
- [ ] **Quiz Scores:** Are students understanding material?
- [ ] **Completion Rates:** Are students finishing quizzes?
- [ ] **Activity Participation:** Are students engaged in class?
- [ ] **Exam Performance:** Does module content stick?

### Feedback Collection:
- [ ] YouTube comments (read all, respond to most)
- [ ] Student surveys (mid-course, end-of-course)
- [ ] Class discussions (verbal feedback)
- [ ] Peer observation (if possible)

### Iterate Based on Data:
- Low watch time → Shorten videos, improve engagement
- Low quiz scores → Clarify explanations, add examples
- Low activity participation → Simplify instructions, make more engaging
- Negative feedback → Address concerns, make adjustments

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Script Too Long
**Solution:** Break into multiple shorter videos, aim for 10-12 min each

### Problem: Audio Quality Poor
**Solution:** Invest in USB microphone ($50-100), record in quiet room

### Problem: Slides Look Boring
**Solution:** Use Canva templates, add diagrams/images, less text per slide

### Problem: Students Not Watching Videos
**Solution:** Make pre-class quiz mandatory, keep videos engaging, use hooks

### Problem: No Time for Video Production
**Solution:** Start with 1 video/month, batch record multiple videos in one session

### Problem: Don't Know What to Teach
**Solution:** Use workflow templates, start with your strongest expertise (SPME)

---
