## 📝 VOICE VS. TONE

**Voice = Consistent (Who You Are)**
Your voice stays the same across all content. It's your personality, your expertise, your perspective.

**Tone = Variable (Situation-Specific)**
Your tone changes based on:
- Audience (students vs. industry professionals)
- Topic (technical deep-dive vs. career advice)
- Platform (LinkedIn vs. academic paper)
- Purpose (educate vs. inspire vs. inform)

## 📏 WRITING GUIDELINES

### **Sentence Structure**

**Do:**
- Mix short and long sentences for rhythm
- Start with strong verbs
- Use active voice primarily
- Vary sentence beginnings

**Example:**
```
"I optimized this method at Deciem. The results surprised me. Traditional 
approaches required 5 hours of prep time. Our SPME method? Fifteen minutes."
```

**Don't:**
- All short sentences (choppy)
- All long sentences (exhausting)
- Passive voice overuse
- Repetitive structure

---

### **Paragraph Structure**

**Do:**
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph (for digital)
- One main idea per paragraph
- Use line breaks generously
- Topic sentence first (usually)

**Don't:**
- Walls of text (7+ sentences)
- Multiple ideas crammed together
- No breathing room
- Bury the lead

---

### **Word Choice**

**Prefer:**
- Strong, specific verbs: "discovered" over "found out"
- Concrete nouns: "40% improvement" over "significant increase"
- Active constructions: "I developed" over "it was developed"
- Simple where possible: "use" over "utilize"

**Avoid:**
- Weak verbs: "make," "do," "get"
- Vague adjectives: "very," "really," "quite"
- Unnecessary jargon
- Clichés: "game-changer," "think outside the box"

---

### **Technical Terms**

**When to Use:**
- Essential to meaning: "SPME," "LC-MS/MS"
- Standard in field: "chromatography," "extraction"
- No simple alternative: "hematocrit," "partition coefficient"

**When to Explain:**
- First mention in content
- Addressing students or broad audience
- Complex or specialized terms
- Acronyms (always spell out first)

**Example:**
```
"We used Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) - essentially a tiny fiber 
coated with material that selectively absorbs target compounds. Think of 
it like a molecular sponge."
```

---

### **Numbers & Data**

**Do:**
- Be specific: "47% improvement" not "significant improvement"
- Use numbers < 10 spelled out in prose, numerals for data
- Include context: "reduced from 5 hours to 15 minutes (95% faster)"
- Visualize when helpful

**Don't:**
- Overload with statistics
- Use data without interpretation
- Claim precision you don't have
- Forget units

---

### **Examples & Analogies**

**Use Them Frequently:**
- Makes abstract concepts concrete
- Increases relatability
- Improves retention
- Shows real-world relevance

**Good Analogies:**
```
"SPME is like dipping a sponge in water - it absorbs what's dissolved 
and carries it to your instrument for measurement."

"Matrix effects in bioanalysis are like trying to hear someone at a 
concert - the signal (your analyte) is there, but background noise 
(other compounds) makes it hard to detect."
```

**Use Analogies From:**
- Everyday life
- Other sciences
- Common experiences
- Visual/physical processes

---

## 🎯 PLATFORM-SPECIFIC TONE ADJUSTMENTS

methods for FDA submissions and industrial R&D, I've learned that 
thorough validation saves time and prevents costly failures.

In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through..."
```

### **Academic Papers**

**Tone:** Formal authority, peer reviewer

**Adjustments:**
- Most formal register
- Passive voice acceptable
- Follow journal style
- Third person often preferred

**Example:**
```
"A systematic investigation of NADES-based SPME coatings was conducted. 
The extraction efficiency was evaluated across multiple analyte classes. 
Results indicated that choline chloride-glucose formulations demonstrated 
superior performance (p < 0.05) compared to traditional coatings."
```

## ✅ VOICE CHECKLIST

Before publishing any content, ask:

- [ ] **Authoritative?** Does it demonstrate expertise without arrogance?
- [ ] **Accessible?** Can target audience understand it?
- [ ] **Evidence-Based?** Are claims supported by data/experience?
- [ ] **Practical?** Does it offer actionable value?
- [ ] **Authentic?** Does it sound like me (not generic AI)?
- [ ] **Engaging?** Would I stop scrolling to read this?
- [ ] **Professional?** Maintains credibility and standards?
- [ ] **Appropriate Tone?** Matches audience and context?

## 🎨 EXAMPLES: SAME TOPIC, DIFFERENT TONES

**Topic: SPME Fiber Conditioning**

**Educational Expert (LinkedIn Carousel):**
```
"Why SPME fiber conditioning matters more than you think

Proper conditioning can improve your extraction efficiency by 30%.

Here's the 5-step process I use in every method development..."
```

**Peer-to-Peer (LinkedIn Post to Professionals):**
```
"Quick question for analytical chemists using SPME:

How long do you condition new fibers before first use?

At Dalriada, we found that standard protocols (2h at 250°C) weren't 
sufficient for some coatings. Extended conditioning (4h) reduced our 
method variability by 15%.

What's been your experience?"
```

**Inspiring Mentor (Career Lesson Post):**
```
"Early in my PhD, I wasted a week because I skipped fiber conditioning.

'It's just a formality,' I thought. 'Won't make that much difference.'

The data disagreed. Badly.

Dr. Pawliszyn didn't say 'I told you so.' Instead, he said something 
better: 'Now you'll never forget why these small steps matter.'

He was right. That mistake made me a better scientist because..."
```

**Thought Leader (Industry Trend Analysis):**
```
"The analytical chemistry field is moving toward miniaturization and 
high-throughput. But here's what most people miss:

As we scale down sample size and speed up analysis, conditioning 
protocols become MORE critical, not less.

Here's why this matters for the future of bioanalytical labs..."
```

**Problem-Solver (Troubleshooting Guide):**
```
"SPME troubleshooting: Poor reproducibility

Symptom: RSD > 15% on replicate extractions
Possible cause: Inadequate fiber conditioning

Quick fix:
1. Remove fiber from holder
2. Condition at 250°C for 4 hours (not 2)
3. Store in sealed vial with desiccant
4. Re-condition 30min before each session

This solved 70% of reproducibility issues in our lab."
```
