**Prompt:**
"Generate a slide deck brief based on source [Insert Source Number/Name].
**Target Audience:** [e.g., Scientists using AI, Lab Managers, PhD Students].

### How to Achieve the 1080x1350 Size

You asked how to get the slides in 1080x1350 pixels. As an AI text model, I generate the **content** formatted for that space, but I cannot generate the **image file** itself.

The content I provided in the previous turn includes specific "Design Notes" to ensure the text fits that size.

**To create the actual file, follow these steps:**

**Option A: Canva (Easiest)**
1.  Open Canva.
2.  Click "Create a design" > "Custom Size".
3.  Enter **1080** for Width and **1350** for Height.
4.  Copy the "Headline" and "Text" from my output into the slides.
5.  Export as **PDF Standard** for LinkedIn.

## For pdf generation:

Generate a professional looking PDF with excellent visual design with ReportLab. Focus on these key aspects: select an appealing color scheme with a primary color and complementary accents that work well together, use proper font sizing and spacing to create visual hierarchy and make content easy to read, incorporate plenty of white space so the document feels clean and uncluttered, style any tables with colors and borders that look polished, add charts or graphics if they enhance the content, and ensure the overall layout is balanced and attractive. The goal is to create a PDF that looks like it was designed by a professional designer with attention to colors typography spacing and visual appeal.

## For article to Image

You are an AI assistant specialized in transforming blog posts into clean, simple infographics. First, analyze the provided content to understand its core message, tone, and subject matter. Then extract 3 to 6 key points that best represent the main message. Choose an appropriate layout style based on content type: timeline for processes or historical topics, comparison for multiple options, statistical for data-heavy content, educational with icons for how-to guides, or narrative for storytelling. Design with generous spacing and white space between all text blocks, sections, and visual elements to ensure readability and avoid crowding. Use only 2 to 4 colors maximum in the entire design to keep it simple and cohesive. Select a background color and accent colors that match the topic and mood: professional blues or grays for business, vibrant colors for lifestyle, earthy tones for environmental subjects, warm tones for food and wellness. Create clear visual hierarchy with proper typography. Include relevant icons or simple data visualizations that enhance comprehension without cluttering. Generate the infographic in high resolution suitable for web and social media sharing. This is the content:

## Hand writeen 

I use three approaches depending on what I’m creating:

Method 1: Brief First
Generate an outline, then create the image.

Method 2: Remix
Take a post that performed well and create a new version.

Method 3: Reference Image
Upload an image you like and recreate the style.

Each method uses a two-step process. First, you create the brief, then you generate the image using the same core prompt.

### The workflow:

Go to Gemini

Ask it to create an infographic brief

Review and edit the brief

Generate the image using the master prompt

Step 1: Generate the Brief

🚀 ## Prompt
 @Janusz Pawliszyn

Use this prompt:



Create an infographic brief for [YOUR TOPIC].

Include visual suggestions.

Step 2: Generate the Image

Once you have your brief, use this prompt:

Generate a single image of a physical, hand-drawn infographic on a large whiteboard or notebook page.

Crucial Style Instructions (Read First):

Medium: The image must look like a photograph of a real whiteboard or large paper notepad.

Texture: All elements must look created by hand using colored marker pens (black, blue, red, green) and highlighters (yellow/orange). Lines should be slightly imperfect, wobbly, and have the texture of ink on a surface.

No Digital Fonts: All text, headings, and bullet points must appear handwritten or hand-printed in marker pen.

Layout: Structure the 1080x1350 image as follows:

Use multi-colored markers for emphasis. Keep text large and legible. Make everything look hand-drawn with slight imperfections. Make it look like a photograph of an actual notebook page.

Always include the handwritten text “Follow Charlie Hills AI Content Creator for more helpful content | Repost ♻️” at the bottom of the image, in the same hand-drawn marker style.

Replace [YOUR TOPIC] with your subject in Step 1. Replace [PASTE YOUR BRIEF HERE] with the output from Step 1. Replace my name with yours in the follow CTA.
