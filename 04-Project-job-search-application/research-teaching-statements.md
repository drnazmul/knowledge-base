### **TEACHING STATEMENT STRUCTURE**

**Title:** Teaching Philosophy: Bridging Research and Practice in Chemistry Education

**I. CORE PHILOSOPHY (½ page)**

I believe effective chemistry education transforms students from passive recipients of information into active problem-solvers who can apply knowledge to real-world challenges. My teaching is guided by three principles:

1. **Research-Led Teaching:** Students learn from research frontier, not just textbooks
2. **Active Learning:** Students construct understanding through doing
3. **Industry Relevance:** Preparation for actual careers, not just academic success

These principles emerged from my experience as both researcher (Ph.D. with world-leading lab, 17 publications) and practitioner (14 years in pharmaceutical and cosmetics R&D).

**II. TEACHING EXPERIENCE (½ page)**

**University of Waterloo (2011-2016):**
- Supervised 200+ undergraduate students in analytical chemistry labs
- **Outstanding Graduate Teaching Award (2013)**
- Developed new laboratory protocols
- Mentored struggling students to success

**Industry Training (2016-2025):**
- Trained laboratory staff on new techniques
- Developed SOPs and training materials
- Mentored junior scientists
- Presented at company seminars

**Current:**
- Guest lectures at collaborating universities
- Informal mentoring of early-career researchers

**III. TEACHING METHODS (¾ page)**

**Flipped Classroom Approach:**
- Pre-class: Videos, readings (content delivery)
