## 📋 COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

### **CATEGORY 1: Research**

**"Tell us about your research."**

**Your Answer Framework:**
- 2-minute elevator pitch (big picture)
- "My research advances green analytical chemistry through three areas: NADES-SPME development, single-cell metabolomics, and industrial applications..."
- Connect to their department ("I see opportunities to collaborate with [faculty name] on...")
- End with question ("What research areas is the department prioritizing?")

**"How will you fund your research?"**

**Your Answer:**
- "Multi-pronged approach: Malaysian grants (FRGS Year 1, MRUN Year 2), industry contracts (leveraging my Deciem/Dalriada network), international collaborations"
- Specific: "I'm preparing FRGS proposal on NADES-Malaysian medicinal plants for submission in [month]"
- Show realism: "I understand startup grants from university typically cover [X], and I'd need access to LC-MS..."

**"How will students be involved in your research?"**

**Your Answer:**
- "Master's students: Defined projects within larger program (NADES synthesis, method optimization)"
- "PhD students: Independent research extending my work"
- "Undergrads: Summer research, honors projects"
- "Publications with students prioritized - I published 6 papers during my PhD showing commitment to student authorship"

---

### **CATEGORY 2: Teaching**

**"Describe your teaching philosophy."**

**Your Answer (Be Authentic, Not Generic):**
- "Research-led, active learning, industry relevance"
- **Concrete example:** "In my Green Chemistry course, Week 3 on NADES - I share actual data from my USM collaboration, including challenges we're facing, inviting students to propose solutions..."
- "I use flipped classroom - pre-class videos, in-class application - maximizes face-to-face time for deep learning"

**"How would you handle a struggling student?"**

**Your Answer:**
- "First, diagnose the issue - is it understanding, study skills, external factors?"
- "Specific example from UWaterloo: Student failing quizzes despite attending - discovered test anxiety. Worked with student services, provided practice tests, result: passed with B"
- "Office hours, peer study groups, university resources, accommodations when needed"
- "My job is student success, not just content delivery"

**"What courses can you teach?"**

**Your Answer (Be Specific):**
- "Prepared to teach: Green Chemistry (complete course designed!), Analytical Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, SPME Methods, Bioanalytical Chemistry, all lab courses"
- "Can develop new courses as needed - took 2 weeks to design complete Green Chemistry course showing ability to build curriculum quickly"

---

### **CATEGORY 3: Fit & Vision**

**"Why our university?"**

**Your Answer (Research Them!):**
- **Monash example:** "Three reasons: (1) New Green Chemistry Master's - I've designed the complete course, ready to implement, (2) Research culture values industry partnerships - my network provides immediate connections, (3) Existing collaboration with Prof. Goh shows I'm already invested in Sunway/Malaysian research community"
- Never: "It's a job" or "Location" as primary reason

**"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**

**Your Answer:**
- "Leading researcher in green analytical chemistry, established lab with 3-4 graduate students, externally funded (FRGS/MRUN/industry), published 10-15 additional papers, developed industry advisory panel for program, potentially promoted to Associate Professor"
- "Contributing to department through curriculum development, student mentoring, service"
- Shows ambition but commitment to THIS university

**"How will you contribute beyond research and teaching?"**

**Your Answer:**
- "Service: Willing to serve on departmental committees, contribute to MQA accreditation, mentor junior faculty"
- "Outreach: Public lectures, high school visits, science fairs"
- "Industry: Build partnerships benefiting students and university reputation"
- "Community: Engage Malaysian chemistry community, conference organizing"

---

### **CATEGORY 4: Challenges & Scenarios**

**"What's your biggest weakness as a teacher?"**

**Your Answer (Honest But Not Disqualifying):**
- "Early in teaching, I tried to cover too much content, sacrificing depth for breadth. Now I focus on fewer topics done deeply, trusting students can learn details independently if foundation is strong"
- Always follow with: "Here's how I addressed it..."

**"How would you handle research disagreement with collaborator?"**

**Your Answer:**
- "Respectful scientific discussion based on data"
- "Example: During my PhD, disagreed with interpretation - presented alternative analysis, we published both perspectives, reviewers appreciated thoroughness"
- "Collaboration thrives on diverse perspectives, not groupthink"

**"How do you balance research and teaching?"**

**Your Answer:**
- "Integration, not balance - my research enriches teaching, teaching generates research questions"
- "Time management: Protected research time (mornings), accessible teaching time (afternoons/office hours)"
- "Realistic: Some semesters research-heavy (grant deadlines), others teaching-heavy (new course prep)"

## 🎤 TEACHING DEMONSTRATION

### **Preparation:**

**Typical Ask:** "30-minute lesson on [topic] for [Master's students/undergraduates]"

**Your Strategy:**
1. **Choose topic carefully** - Pick something you're expert in (NADES, SPME) or core to position (Green Chemistry Principles)
2. **Active learning required** - Don't just lecture! Include activity/discussion
3. **Start strong** - Hook them in first 2 minutes
4. **Time management** - Practice to finish in 25 min (leave time for Q&A)
5. **Prepare materials** - Handouts, slides, props

**Recommended Demonstration:**
- **Topic:** "Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents - Nature's Green Solvents"
- **Why:** Shows expertise, research integration, timely topic, engaging
- **Structure:**
  - Hook (2 min): "If I told you we could replace toxic solvents with sugar and salt, would you believe me?"
  - Overview (1 min): Learning objectives clear
  - Content (15 min): NADES principles, examples, properties
  - **ACTIVITY (8 min):** Groups design NADES for specific application, present
  - Wrap-up (4 min): Key takeaways, questions

**Bring:**
- Backup slides (USB + cloud)
- Handouts (enough for committee + 5 extras)
- Props if doing demo (actual NADES sample?)
- Whiteboard markers (don't assume they'll provide)

**During:**
- Make eye contact with committee
