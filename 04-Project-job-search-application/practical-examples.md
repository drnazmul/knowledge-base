## DAYS 2-3: COVER LETTER

**Conversation:**

**Claude:**
```
For Monash, we'll use Template 1 (Monash-specific) from
cover-letter-templates.md, customizing it for YOU.

Before I draft, quick questions:
1. Any specific faculty you know of or want to mention?
2. Anything from job posting to especially address?
3. Timeline you can start?
```

**Dr. Alam:**
```
1. I don't know specific faculty yet
2. They emphasize "can design Master's courses" and "MQA knowledge desirable"
3. I can start August 2025
```

**Claude Drafts:**
```
[Provides complete 3-page cover letter]

KEY PARAGRAPH (Opening):
"I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Lecturer
position for the new Master's program in Green & Sustainable Chemistry
at Monash University Malaysia. With a Ph.D. in Analytical Chemistry
from Professor Janusz Pawliszyn's world-leading SPME laboratory, 17
peer-reviewed publications, and 14 years bridging academic research
with industry R&D, I am uniquely positioned to establish this program
as a regional leader.

What particularly excites me is that I have ALREADY designed a
comprehensive Master's course in Green & Sustainable Chemistry—complete
with 12-week syllabus, MQA-compliant learning outcomes, assessment
strategy, and industry partnership plan. This 60-page blueprint is
ready for immediate implementation, reflecting my commitment to Monash
and understanding that new programs require vision from day one."

[Letter continues, emphasizing: Industry experience $50K savings,
Malaysian collaborations, MQA understanding, research-led teaching,
complete course designed]

Review this and let me know if you want any changes!
```

**Dr. Alam:**
```
This is excellent! Just one thing - can you mention my collaboration
with Sunway more prominently? And emphasize the single-cell work?
```

**Claude:**
```
Absolutely! Here's the revised paragraph 3 with stronger Sunway emphasis:

[Revised version]

Better?
```

**Dr. Alam:**
```
Perfect! Save this as Alam_CoverLetter_Monash_Feb2025.docx
```

---

## DAYS 4-5: TEACHING PHILOSOPHY & RESEARCH STATEMENT

**Dr. Alam:**
```
Now I need teaching philosophy and research statement.

Teaching philosophy should emphasize the flipped classroom and
industry integration.

Research statement should focus on NADES-SPME and single-cell work,
with Malaysian medicinal plants applications.
```

**Claude:**
```
I'll customize both from the templates.

TEACHING PHILOSOPHY (2 pages):
- Core principles: Research-led, active learning, industry relevance
- Flipped classroom approach (Monash-aligned!)
- Your Deciem/Dalriada examples
- Complete course demonstrates approach

RESEARCH STATEMENT (3 pages):
- Vision: Establish Monash as regional green chemistry leader
- Direction 1: NADES-SPME platform (your USM collaboration)
- Direction 2: Single-cell metabolomics (your Sunway collaboration)
- Direction 3: Industry partnerships (Malaysian medicinal plants, 
  palm oil QC, pharma/cosmetics applications)
- Funding strategy: FRGS Year 1, MRUN Year 2, industry contracts

Drafting now...

[Provides both documents]

□ Review MQA accreditation process
□ Prepare questions to ask them

PHASE 2: PRACTICE (Week 3-4)
□ Prepare answers to common questions
□ Practice teaching demonstration (30-min NADES lecture)
□ Prepare research presentation (45-min)
□ Conduct mock interviews with me

PHASE 3: LOGISTICS (Week 5)
□ Confirm interview format (phone/video/campus)
□ Research presentation prepared
□ Teaching demo materials ready
□ Professional attire sorted

Let's start with common questions. I'll ask, you answer, I'll give 
feedback. Ready?
```

### **Mock Interview Session**

**Claude:**
```
Tell me about your research.
```

**Dr. Alam:**
```
My research advances green analytical chemistry through development of
sustainable extraction and analysis methods. During my PhD at Waterloo,
I worked with Prof. Pawliszyn on SPME, publishing 6 papers in Analytical
Chemistry. Since then, I've expanded into NADES through collaboration
with USM, and I'm working on single-cell metabolomics with Sunway.
What makes my work unique is bridging fundamental research with
industrial implementation - I actually reduced solvent use by 90% at
Deciem, saving $50K annually while maintaining quality.
```

**Claude:**
```
FEEDBACK:
✅ Strong opening (clear, concise)
✅ Good credential drop (Pawliszyn, Analytical Chemistry)
✅ Excellent bridging to current work
✅ GREAT industry connection at end ($50K saves is powerful)

IMPROVEMENT:
- Add one sentence about future direction at Monash specifically
- Example: "At Monash, I would establish a NADES-SPME research program
  accessible to Master's students, with applications to Malaysian
  medicinal plants in partnership with local industries."

Try again with this addition?
```

**[They continue practicing 15 common questions...]**

### **Teaching Demonstration Prep**

**Dr. Alam:**
```
They'll ask for a 30-minute teaching demo. I want to do NADES.

✅ Your research expertise
✅ Green chemistry focus
✅ Engaging topic
✅ Research-led teaching
